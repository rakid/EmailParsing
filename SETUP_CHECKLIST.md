### üîë Core Deployment Secrets (Required)
```
VERCEL_TOKEN=<your-vercel-token>
VERCEL_ORG_ID=<your-vercel-org-id>
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=<your-vercel-project-id>
```

### üîç Quality & Analytics Secrets (Recommended)
```
CODECOV_TOKEN=<your-codecov-token>
SONAR_TOKEN=<your-sonarcloud-token>
```

### üß™ Performance Testing Secret
```
VERCEL_PRODUCTION_URL=https://email-parsing-three.vercel.app
```

### üê≥ Docker Publishing (Optional)
```
DOCKER_USERNAME=<your-docker-username>
DOCKER_PASSWORD=<your-docker-token>
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Commands

### 1. Get Vercel Configuration
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login and link project
vercel login
cd /path/to/EmailParsing
vercel link

# Get project details
vercel env ls
# Note down the ORG_ID and PROJECT_ID from the output
```

### 2. Setup SonarCloud (Optional but Recommended)
1. Visit https://sonarcloud.io
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Import the repository: `rakid/EmailParsing`
4. Copy the project token from project settings
5. Update organization in `sonar-project.properties` if needed

### 3. Setup Codecov (Optional but Recommended)
1. Visit https://codecov.io
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Add repository: `rakid/EmailParsing`
4. Copy the upload token

## üîß Post-Setup Verification

### Test the CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
# 1. Make a small change to trigger workflows
echo "# CI/CD Test" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: trigger CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main

# 2. Check workflow status
# Visit: https://github.com/rakid/EmailParsing/actions
```

### Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check deployment health
curl https://email-parsing-three.vercel.app/health

# Test webhook endpoint
curl -X POST https://email-parsing-three.vercel.app/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "ping"}'
```

### Test Manual Workflows
1. Go to https://github.com/rakid/EmailParsing/actions/workflows/performance.yml
2. Click "Run workflow" to test performance testing
3. Monitor the results

## üìä Expected Workflow Status

Once secrets are configured, you should see:

- ‚úÖ **Deploy to Vercel**: Runs on every push to main
- ‚úÖ **Code Quality**: Runs on PRs and pushes, weekly schedule
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Management**: Runs weekly on Mondays
- ‚úÖ **Performance Testing**: Manual trigger + monthly schedule
- ‚úÖ **Release Management**: Triggered by tag creation

- **Codecov**: https://codecov.io/gh/rakid/EmailParsing

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Repository secret not found"**
   - Ensure secrets are added to the repository (not organization)
   - Check secret names match exactly (case-sensitive)

2. **Vercel deployment fails**
   - Verify VERCEL_TOKEN has sufficient permissions
   - Check VERCEL_ORG_ID and VERCEL_PROJECT_ID are correct
   - Ensure Vercel project is linked to the correct GitHub repository

3. **SonarCloud analysis fails**
   - Verify SONAR_TOKEN is valid and not expired
   - Check if SonarCloud organization/project exists
   - Update `sonar-project.properties` with correct organization key

4. **Performance tests fail**
   - Ensure deployment is accessible at VERCEL_PRODUCTION_URL
   - Check if the health endpoint is responding
   - Verify webhook endpoint is not rate-limited

## üéØ Next Steps After Setup

1. **Configure Postmark Integration**
   ```bash
   # Update your Postmark webhook URL to:
   https://email-parsing-three.vercel.app/webhook
   ```

2. **Monitor Initial Runs**
   - Watch the first few CI/CD runs for any issues
   - Check code quality metrics in SonarCloud
   - Verify dependency update PRs from Dependabot

3. **Create Your First Release**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   # This will trigger the release workflow
   ```

4. **Review Documentation**
   - Update any repository-specific details in README.md
   - Add any custom deployment instructions
   - Document any environment-specific configurations

## ‚ú® Success Criteria

Your setup is complete when:
- [ ] All GitHub Actions workflows show green status
- [ ] Vercel deployment is accessible and healthy
- [ ] SonarCloud analysis runs without errors
- [ ] Dependabot creates dependency update PRs
- [ ] Performance tests complete successfully
