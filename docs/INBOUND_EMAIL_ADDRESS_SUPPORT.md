# Inbound Email Address Support

## üéØ Overview

The Inbox Zen MCP Server fully supports Postmark's `inbound_email_address` (MailboxHash) functionality, enabling sophisticated email routing and processing based on the specific email address that received the message.

## üìß Postmark Integration

### Supported Fields

The application now captures and processes these Postmark inbound email fields:

```json
{
  "MailboxHash": "support-inbox-hash-123",
  "OriginalRecipient": "support@mycompany.com", 
  "SpamScore": 0.1,
  "VirusDetected": false,
  "ReplyTo": "sender@example.com",
  "Tag": "support-emails",
  "MessageStream": "inbound"
}
```

### EmailData Model Enhancement

The `EmailData` model includes these new fields:

```python
class EmailData(BaseModel):
    # ... existing fields ...
    
    # Inbound email routing
    inbound_email_address: Optional[str]  # MailboxHash from Postmark
    original_recipient: Optional[str]     # Original recipient before forwarding
    
    # Email security and quality
    spam_score: Optional[float]           # Spam score from provider
    virus_detected: Optional[bool]        # Virus detection result
    
    # Additional metadata
    reply_to: Optional[str]               # Reply-To header
    message_stream: Optional[str]         # Postmark message stream
    tag: Optional[str]                    # Postmark tag
```

## üîÄ Email Routing System

### Automatic Routing

Emails are automatically routed based on their `inbound_email_address`:

```python
# Example routing logic
if email.inbound_email_address == "support-hash":
    # Route to support team with high priority
    email.headers["X-Priority"] = "high"
    email.headers["X-Forward-To-Team"] = "support"
```

### Default Routing Rules

| Inbound Address Pattern | Action | Team | Priority |
|------------------------|--------|------|----------|
| `support`, `help`, `contact` | Process Priority | Support | 100 |
| `sales`, `info`, `hello` | Forward to Team | Sales | 90 |
| `billing`, `invoices`, `payments` | Forward to Team | Finance | 80 |
| `noreply`, `no-reply`, `donotreply` | Archive | None | 70 |

### Custom Routing Rules

Add custom routing rules programmatically:

```python
from src.email_routing import email_router, RoutingRule, RoutingAction

# Add custom rule
custom_rule = RoutingRule(
    name="vip_customers",
    description="Route VIP customer emails to priority queue",
    inbound_addresses=["vip", "premium", "enterprise"],
    action=RoutingAction.PROCESS_PRIORITY,
    priority=150,
    metadata={"team": "vip_support", "sla_hours": 1}
)

email_router.add_rule(custom_rule)
```

### Pattern Matching

The routing system supports multiple pattern types:

```python
# Exact match
inbound_addresses=["support"]

# Contains match  
inbound_addresses=["support-"]  # Matches "support-team", "support-billing"

# Regex match
inbound_addresses=["regex:^(help|support)-.*"]  # Matches "help-billing", "support-tech"
```

## üîß Configuration

### Postmark Setup

1. **Configure Inbound Domain:**
   ```
   Set up inbound processing in Postmark dashboard
   Configure webhook URL: https://your-app.vercel.app/webhook
   ```

2. **Enable Required Fields:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Include raw email content (optional)
   ‚úÖ Include spam score
   ‚úÖ Include virus detection
   ‚úÖ Include original recipient
   ```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Postmark configuration
POSTMARK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret

# Optional: Enable advanced routing
EMAIL_ROUTING_ENABLED=true

```

## üìä Monitoring and Analytics

### Routing Metrics

Monitor routing effectiveness:

```bash
# Check routing statistics
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/routing/stats | jq '.runtime_stats'

# View routing rules
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/routing/rules | jq '.rules[].name'

# Get emails by specific inbound address
curl "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/emails/by-inbound-address?inbound_address=support-hash"
```

### Health Check Integration

The routing system is included in health checks:

```bash
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/health/services | jq '.services.postmark.details'
```

## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. Department Routing

```python
# Route emails to different departments
support_rule = RoutingRule(
    name="support_routing",
    inbound_addresses=["support", "help", "technical"],
    action=RoutingAction.FORWARD_TO_TEAM,
    metadata={"team": "support", "slack_channel": "#support"}
)
```

### 2. Priority Processing

```python
# VIP customer priority
vip_rule = RoutingRule(
    name="vip_priority",
    inbound_addresses=["vip", "enterprise"],
    action=RoutingAction.PROCESS_PRIORITY,
    metadata={"sla_hours": 1, "escalate": True}
)
```

### 3. Automated Archiving

```python
# Archive automated emails
archive_rule = RoutingRule(
    name="auto_archive",
    inbound_addresses=["noreply", "automated"],
    action=RoutingAction.ARCHIVE,
    metadata={"auto_archive": True}
)
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Test inbound email address support
python test_inbound_email_support.py

# Expected output:
# üéâ All inbound email address tests passed!
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MailboxHash not captured:**
   - Verify Postmark webhook includes all fields
   - Check webhook payload in logs

2. **Routing not working:**
   - Verify routing rules are enabled
   - Check pattern matching logic
   - Review routing logs

3. **API endpoints returning 404:**
   - Ensure email routing module is imported
   - Check API routes are loaded

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if routing is working
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/routing/stats

# View recent emails with routing info
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/emails/recent | jq '.emails[].routing_rule'

# Test specific inbound address
curl "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/emails/by-inbound-address?inbound_address=your-hash"
```
